# student-performance-ml
Machine Learning project to analyze and predict student academic performance using regression model'
## project overvive 
This project analysis student acadaminc data and builda machine learning models to predict final outcomes based on study habits and background factors.
## Problem Statement
The outcomes of student acadaminc are infulenced by various interconected factors. This project aims to identifiy key contributors to perform and evaluate predective models using statistical and machine learning techniques.
## Dataset descripition 
A public student performance dataset contaning acadamic, social and demographic features are used.
## Methodology 
The project follows a structured pipeline:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Regression-based modeling
- Model evaluation and comparsion
## Mathematical Background
Key concepts include:
- Correlation analysis
- Linear regression
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Coefficient of determination (R^2)
# Results 
- Linear Regression: RMSE is approx. 4.2, R^2 is approx. 0.14
- Decision Tree and Random Forest models improved predictive performance
- Attendence, prior acadiemic difficulties, and study-related beheviors were among the most influential features

Feature importance analysis was condected using a Random Forest model with prior grades excluded to prevent data leakege.  

## Limitations 
This project uses observational data, which may introduce bias and does not imply causation 
## Future IMprovments 
Future work may include advance models and larger datasets
